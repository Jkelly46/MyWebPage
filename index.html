                            Thank you for visiting my page! My name is John and I am from New York City, USA. 
                            While I currently work in Web Development, my background is in Early Years and Primary Education. I hold a BA 
                            in Geman Studies and English Literature, A Postgraduate Certificate in Education and a TESOL Certificate for teaching English. More recently I entered 
                            the wonderful world of Web Dev by completing a course with Open Classrooms and starting work as a Junior Web Developer at a small tech company. I try to
                            apply my skills and background while working on education-related design projects and always seek to learn new things and improve my skills!

                                I completed a six-month associate-level diploma in web development, conducted entirely online with the help of a dedicated mentor.
                                In studying to be an entry-level developer, I learned to bring the mockups created by UX designers to life.
                                I translated these graphic recommendations into web languages by writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.</span></li>

                                time. This entailed a heavy emphasis on personal and social development whereby I constantly
                                exposed children to and encouraged them to use English in the context of growing and maturing with
                                their peers. This provided the additional benefit of developing their fluency and grammatical
                                awareness. Having personally reached an advanced level of Russian, I also used this knowledge to
                                identify the underlying reason for student errors and predict areas of difficulty, both through the
